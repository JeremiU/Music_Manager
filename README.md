# Music Sheet Man

This is a personal project meant to help automate some tasks for my music listening spreadsheet, which I use to track what albums I have listened to (since 2018). What initially started out as a simple notes list has turned into a [multiple tab google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xWcdoaLc6uEPyIFdZZWAj8NKvB7A0HDs-9SewYEsl1I/edit#gid=361348686), with a decent amount of data, so automating certain tasks could save me a lot of time.

## APIs used

This project uses the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) and the [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts). In the future, it may use the [Last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api/intro) in order to add entries based on the albums I have listened to recently.
